# About the project

In this project I created an app which gives a daily horoscope based on a date chosen from an input. Inputs and buttons are conntected, because of that button is active only if user writes data in a (according to RegEx) proper way. User's data are passed to the horoscope page in url.
The app uses a free horoscope api. In layout I used flexbox, that's why a design is responsive.
